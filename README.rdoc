FINAL PROJECT - 
Build a RoR app with log in capability and relational database.

I created a bookmark app that allows the user to sign in and add/edit/delete bookmarks. Bookmarks are linked to users with a one to many relationship.

These are the additional features that I included in my app:

* Used paperclip gem to include profile pic/avatar

* Added medium and thumb sized missing.png images as generic default profile pic

* Integrated Bootstrap to make front end more attractive
